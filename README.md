## Project Description

- Proposal Management System thats  helps them manage their proposal review process. They need a system that will allow applicants to get a link in their emails to allow them access. Once in a user should be able to create a proposal, save it as draft then when ready submit it for review.


- They also need an admin panel where they can view a list of proposals sent, click on one to review it, if they like it move it on to stage-1 otherwise mark it as rejected. Proposals in stage-1 are then reviewed and moved to stage-2 or rejected. Finally from stage-2 the proposal can either be accepted or rejected.

-  The applicants should automatically be notified via email when their proposal is rejected or accepted. The admin should also see a notification on the system when a new proposal is sent.
